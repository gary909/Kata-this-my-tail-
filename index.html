        Some new animals have arrived at the zoo. The zoo keeper is concerned <br>
        that perhaps the animals do not have the right tails. To help her, you  <br>
        must correct the broken function to make sure that the second argument  <br>
        (tail), is the same as the last letter of the first argument (body) <br>
         - otherwise the tail wouldn't fit! <br>
         <br>
        If the tail is right return true, else return false. <br>
        <br>
        The arguments will always be non empty strings, and normal letters. <br>
